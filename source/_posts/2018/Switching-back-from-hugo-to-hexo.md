Been relly since I blogged anything. Primary reasons being that blogging and searching through the existing blog has become tougher than needed. I suspect that was because of Hugo and the theme I has selected in it.

Spent today shifting all my blog back from hugo to hexo. Paid a heavy price for not sticking as closely to Markdown spec as possible.

It was a close call between [Hexo Next](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next) and [Icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) theme. Finally went with Hexo Next for the ease of use.

Now live at https://www.sahil.cc
