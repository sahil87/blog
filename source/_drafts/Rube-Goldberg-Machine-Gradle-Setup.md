Just like the [Rube Goldberg Contraption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) 
To learn algorithms,
I started Course Era course
To test which I needed a Java Project
To which I needed to input stuff
For which I need Junit 
Hence I did research on the best testing framework
And found out about spock
And needed a project setup manager like Gradle
ANd learnt gradle
