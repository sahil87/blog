Hi! I am Sahil Ahuja, a student of technology building the next generation of systems that will power the VR ecosystem.

As Founder and CTO at GMETRI, my focus is on building and deploying a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform that enables the next wave of applications of immersive technologies.

I have built products and companies from ground up, with experience ranging from trading at BAML's Treasury to software development in fin-tech@Goldman Sachs and heading technology@SportsCafe. At SportsCafe as CTO my primary focus area was fabricating scalable DevOps solutions for high traffic, apart from overall architecture.

My interest areas include designing scalable systems end-to-end, implementing best practices, simplifying cloud agnostic DevOps through Kunbernetes, Ansible automation, Web Technologies and Mixed Reality. I like using emacs, zsh, NodeJS, ES7/JSX ecosystem. Am also a free software advocate, photographer and love playing chess.

Learning how to play [Violin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin) and [Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_piano) with [Sheet Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music), trying to improve my [Relative Pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_pitch) and going through online [courses](https://www.class-central.com/u/247939). I graduated from [NIT Trichy](http://www.nitt.edu/home/students/clubsnassocs/computing/delta/alumni/up208/) and have an MBA from [IIM-C](https://www.iimcal.ac.in/about/campus-life/life-iimc/clubs-and-sigs/isg-internet-solutions-group).
